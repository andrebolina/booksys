# Booksys

### App developed by [André Bolina](https://www.bolina.com.br/)

#### Scenario
A bookstore in the city has seen an increase in the number of copies and has a problem identifying all the books it has in stock. To help the bookstore you were asked to develop a web application to manage these copies.

#### Requirements
- [x] The system should show all registered books ordered in ascending order by name
- [x] The system should allow registering a book
- [x] The system should allow editing of a book
- [x] Books must be persisted in a database

#### Other Requirements
- [x] For data persistence some ORM framework must be used

#### Differentials
- [x] Use web api for communication between front and backend
- [x] Use JQuery frontend framework
- [x] Use Bootstrap frontend framework

#### Additional points
- [x] The system must be developed on the .NET platform
- [x] Can use ASP .Net MVC
- [x] The code must be made available on Github

------------------

#### Notes
The application was developed to the described scenario, having all the requirements, fulfilling all the differentials and additional points. I would also like to highlight the following points:
- [x] Creation of name to solution
- [x] Creation of visual identity (logo) for the solution
- [x] Use of jQuery plugin to select the year of the book
- [x] Use of jQuery plugin to format the book value
- [x] Use of jQuery plugin for temporary messages when actions are performed
- [x] Color of the records in the main listing according to the book's stock (captions in the interface)
- [x] Responsive system

*The developed sections with greater complexity and impact on the code are all commented (in portuguese) and have '#Comment' to facilitate their localization.*
